         <documentation>
            MultiTime is a general-purpose structure that records a common pattern of flight 
            time: 
             
            * estimated 
            * actual 
            * controlled 
            * earliest 
            * etc. 
             
            This base implementation of MultiTime contains only "actual" and "estimated" time 
            values. It is assumed 
            that users of MultiTime will extend it by adding attributes for the other time types 
            that they need. It is recommended that these extensions also use cardinality 0..1 
            for new time elements. 
             
            Each of these times is an instance of a ReportedTime, and each recorded time is decorated 
            with a Provenance block that describes the system that contributed it, so that data 
            fusion systems can sort out which of the competing times to believe.

            TimeSequence represents important times in a process that spans some time and has 
            multiple steps. Each element of TimeSequence represents a record of the actual time 
            associated with each step of the process. TimeSequence does not require that all 
            steps of the process be present or complete, and it does not permit multiple occurrences 
            of the same step. 
             
            This base implementation of TimeSequence contains only "approval", "begin", "end", 
            "ready", and "request" times. It is assumed that users of this type will extend it 
            by adding intermediate steps.
